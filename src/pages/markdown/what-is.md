# What is

This site is maintained by [**CRAAM**](https://www.mackenzie.br/centro-de-radio-astronomia-e-astrofisica-mackenzie) (Mackenzie Radio Astronomy and Astrophysics Center)] 
a research center operated by the [**UPM**](https://www.mackenzie.br/) (Mackenzie Presbyterian University) and 
[**INPE**](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br) (National Institute for Space Research), to provide public and free access for researchers, students and the interested general publicccess 
to **VLF** (Very Low Frequency) data from CRAAM's Antennas systems. 
All data stored is supported by [**Amazon AWS**](https://aws.amazon.com) supported by [**AWS Open Data Program**](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/opendata/).
	
**Very Low Frequency (VLF)** signals can be used for navigation services, communication with submarines and are a powerful tool to study the low altitude Earth's ionosphere, 
atmospheric and geophysics phenomena, space weather, magnetic field and solar flares. 
Here, we will provide historical and updated VLF data from two CRAAM’s system antennas, the **SAVNET** and  **AWESOME systems**. 

The **SAVNET** consists of a network of receiving/tracking 11 VLF stations, located in Latin America and Antarctica. Five stations are in Brazil, 3 in Peru, 1 in Argentina, 1 in Mexico 
and 1 in the Brazilian Antarctic Research Station Comandante Ferraz. The **CRAAM’s AWESOME systems** include two antennas (Brazil and Antarctica). 
Data since 2002 from both systema are available with some absence of data during periods when collections are interrupted.
