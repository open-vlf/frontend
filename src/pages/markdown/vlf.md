# VLF

**Very Low Frequency (VLF)** signals typically occupy the frequency range from 3 kHz (kilohertz) to 30 kHz signals and are known to propagate over long distances within the waveguide bounded by the Earth’s surface and the lower ionosphere (D-region at daytime and E-region at nighttime). The longer wavelengths from VLF compared to higher-frequency radio waves, which gives them unique propagation characteristics. They can be affected by factors like the Earth's curvature, ground conductivity, and the ionosphere.

These characteristics made VLF suitable for many research and applications:

1. Research ionosphere phenomena’s: VLF can be used to capture many phenomena’s that affect ionosphere, such as solar
   flares, space weather and the magnetosphere.

2. Submarine Communication: VLF signals can penetrate seawater to a significant depth, making them suitable for
   long-range communication with submarines.

3. Earthquakes and Lightning Detection: VLF signals can be used to detect natural phenomena such as earthquakes and
   lightning strikes. Changes in VLF signal propagation can indicate seismic activity or electrical discharges in the
   atmosphere.

Among other applications.
