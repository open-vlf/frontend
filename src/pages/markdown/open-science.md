# Open Science

Open scientific data or open research data is a type of open data focused on publishing observations and results of
scientific activities available for anyone to analyze and reuse. A major purpose of the drive for open data is to allow
the verification of scientific claims, by allowing others to look at the reproducibility of results. and to allow data
from many sources to be integrated to give new knowledge. The modern concept of scientific data emerged in the second
half of the 20th century, with the development of large knowledge infrastructure to compute scientific information and
observation. The sharing and distribution of data has been early identified as an important stake but was impeded by the
technical limitations of the infrastructure and the lack of common standards for data communication. The World Wide Web
was immediately conceived as a universal protocol for the sharing of scientific data, especially coming from high-energy
physics.
